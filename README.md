This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


## Team Setup & Running Locally (with Docker)

### Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed
- (Optional) [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you want to run scripts outside Docker

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd ublog
cd ublog
```

### 2. Copy the example environment file (if needed)
Edit `.env` with your own secrets if required.

### 3. Build and start the app & database
```bash
docker compose up
```
This will start both the Next.js app and the Postgres database. The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 4. (Optional) Seed demo data
To populate the database with demo users and posts:
```bash
docker compose run --rm app sh -c "npx prisma generate && npx ts-node prisma/seed.ts"
```

### 5. Stopping the app
run:
```bash
docker compose down
```

---

You do **not** need to install Node.js dependencies or set up a database manuallyâ€”Docker handles everything!

If you have any issues, make sure Docker is running and you are in the `ublog/ublog` directory before running commands.
